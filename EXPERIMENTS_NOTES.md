# SimplexFold Experiment Notes

## 2026-05-09

- Target is `val_lddt_ca > 0.7` on NanoFold validation with parameters within
  5% of AF2 medium.
- All experiment runs should be on Runpod CUDA pods. Local execution is only
  for tests, linting, and non-evidential smoke debugging.
- Current public data size: 10,000 train chains and 1,000 validation chains.
- `simplexfold_medium_param_matched` is the primary profile because it is
  essentially exactly parameter-matched to AF2 medium while preserving medium
  layer counts.
- Important correction: generic metric-aligned losses are not enough. Changes
  must be mediated by simplex topology, selected face/tetra cells, boundary
  geometry, topology quality, or simplex-to-pair/single message passing.
- Rejected a generic all-pairs C-alpha distance loss because it is independent
  of the simplicial view.
- E00 smoke baseline completed locally:
  `artifacts/nanofold_public_benchmarks/e00_smoke_baseline/results.csv`.
  This was only `train-limit=8`, `val-limit=4`, `steps=2`, `crop=32`,
  `msa-depth=8`, so the absolute scores are not meaningful. It verified that
  the runner works on MPS and that `no_simplex`, `faces`, and `full` all run.
- E00 smoke final `val_lddt_ca`: `no_simplex=0.0429`, `faces=0.0935`,
  `full=0.0934`.
- The local smoke numbers above are not part of the experiment evidence after
  the Runpod-only decision. Use `e00_runpod_baseline` as the control run.
- E01 implemented a balanced contact loss inside `SimplexGeometryLoss` for
  `simplex_contact_logits`. Positive and negative contact terms are normalized
  separately, then averaged per example. This is a topology-quality change:
  the supervised logits are the same logits used to build the first-pass
  sparse neighbor graph.
- E01 local targeted tests passed:
  `tests/test_simplex.py::test_simplex_contact_loss_balances_contacts_and_non_contacts`,
  `tests/test_simplex.py::test_simplex_geometry_loss_adds_distance_and_consistency_terms`,
  `tests/test_simplex.py::test_tiny_alphafold2_profile_emits_simplex_training_tensors`,
  `tests/test_trainer.py::test_simplexfold_medium_param_matched_matches_af2_medium_budget`,
  and `tests/test_trainer.py::test_load_model_config_selects_requested_profile`.
- Launched dedicated Runpod pod `sytp4e4kjs7e61`
  (`codex-simplexfold-e01-runpod-20260509`) for SimplexFold experiments.
  Do not manage or modify pre-existing Runpod instances for this study.
- Runpod BF16 smoke failed on main/full before training completed due a
  PyTorch activation-checkpoint recomputation metadata mismatch. Conservative
  pilot runs should use `--mixed-precision off` until checkpointing and BF16
  are made compatible.
- Runpod fp32 smoke passed for main/full and E01/full with
  `train-limit=8`, `val-limit=4`, `steps=2`, `crop=128`, `msa-depth=32`.
  These numbers are smoke-only and not evidence for the study.
- E01 Runpod pilot completed on pod `sytp4e4kjs7e61`:
  main/full control commit `a299438` vs E01/full commit `6c20faa`,
  `train-limit=256`, `val-limit=64`, `steps=1000`, `crop=128`,
  `msa-depth=32`, `mixed-precision=off`.
- E01 final `val_lddt_ca` did not beat control:
  control `0.0401`, E01 `0.0316`.
- E01 best interim `val_lddt_ca` was slightly higher:
  control best `0.0992` at step 400, E01 best `0.1096` at step 400.
  Interpretation: balanced contact supervision can improve some early topology
  selection points but is not sufficient as a standalone change.
- Next candidate: a row-wise topology neighborhood loss that directly trains
  each anchor residue's contact logits as a distribution over `N(i)`, the
  sparse neighbor star used to instantiate faces and tetras.
- E02 implemented the row-wise topology neighborhood loss inside
  `SimplexGeometryLoss` with no parameter-count change.
- E02 local targeted tests passed:
  `tests/test_simplex.py::test_simplex_topology_neighborhood_loss_targets_anchor_neighbors`,
  E01 simplex loss/runner tests, and the medium budget/profile tests.
- E02 Runpod pilot completed on pod `sytp4e4kjs7e61`, treatment commit
  `e09b88f`, same 1000-step full-variant protocol. Final `val_lddt_ca`
  was `0.0281`; best interim was `0.1127` at step 800. This is the best
  interim score so far but does not solve final collapse.
- E03 implemented warm-started simplex boundary message projections so
  face/tetra states influence pair and single streams immediately rather than
  starting as identity residuals. No parameter-count change.
- E03 Runpod pilot completed on pod `sytp4e4kjs7e61`, treatment commit
  `8320da1`, same 1000-step full-variant protocol. Final `val_lddt_ca`
  improved to `0.0742`; best interim improved to `0.1311` at step 800.
  This is the first tested change that improves both best interim and final
  validation against the main/full control.

## Scaled E03 Pilot

- Ran E03 on the same dedicated Runpod pod with `train-limit=1024`,
  `val-limit=128`, `steps=3000`, `crop=256`, `msa-depth=64`,
  `mixed-precision=off`.
- Result path on the Runpod network volume:
  `/workspace/codex-simplexfold-e03-scaled-20260509/results/e03_warm_boundary_scaled_c256_m64_s3000`.
- Best scaled `val_lddt_ca`: `0.1219` at step 1000.
- Final scaled `val_lddt_ca`: `0.1009` at step 3000.
- Final scaled FoldScore: `0.2346`.
- Interpretation: E03 improves over the initial control but remains far from
  the `0.7` target. The persistent issue is structural collapse or
  under-expansion: predicted C-alpha radius of gyration remains much smaller
  than the true structures in these pilots.
- Stopped dedicated Runpod pod `sytp4e4kjs7e61` after runs completed.
- E04 implemented selected-simplex coordinate realization losses: predicted
  C-alpha face areas and tetra signed/absolute volume plus radius of gyration
  are compared only on the model's selected sparse face/tetra cells. This is
  intended to address collapse while staying mediated by the explicit
  simplicial complex.
- E04 1000-step Runpod diagnostic completed on pod `sytp4e4kjs7e61` at commit
  `02a8bad`: final `val_lddt_ca=0.2200`, final FoldScore `0.2422`,
  `val_ca_rmsd=14.1964`, `val_ca_drmsd=14.9499`,
  `val_pred_ca_rg=5.3194`, `val_true_ca_rg=14.6867`. This is the best
  validation score so far and supports the selected-simplex coordinate
  realization direction.
- E04 scaled Runpod follow-up completed with `train-limit=1024`,
  `val-limit=128`, `steps=3000`, `crop=256`, `msa-depth=64`,
  `mixed-precision=off`.
- E04 scaled best checkpoint was step 1500: `val_lddt_ca=0.2394`,
  `val_ca_rmsd=15.1042`, `val_ca_drmsd=15.2812`, FoldScore `0.2341`,
  `val_pred_ca_rg=6.2108`, `val_true_ca_rg=15.4034`.
- E04 scaled final checkpoint was step 3000: `val_lddt_ca=0.1985`,
  `val_ca_rmsd=15.3330`, `val_ca_drmsd=16.7843`, FoldScore `0.2399`,
  `val_pred_ca_rg=4.8384`, `val_true_ca_rg=15.7622`.
- Interpretation: E04 is the strongest tested direction and confirms selected
  simplex coordinate realization can lift scaled validation lDDT, but the
  realized structure still collapses after the peak and remains far below the
  `0.7` target.
- E05 exposes separate selected face/tetra coordinate-realization weights so
  the next Runpod experiment can strengthen only the topology-mediated
  coordinate terms. Defaults are unchanged unless the runner passes
  `--simplex-face-coordinate-weight` or `--simplex-tetra-coordinate-weight`.
- E05 launched on pod `sytp4e4kjs7e61` at commit `5672991` with the same
  scaled protocol as E04 and both selected coordinate weights set to `0.5`.
- E05 completed on pod `sytp4e4kjs7e61`: final and best
  `val_lddt_ca=0.2948`, final FoldScore `0.2647`, `val_ca_rmsd=15.1656`,
  `val_ca_drmsd=14.9898`, `val_pred_ca_rg=6.5441`, and
  `val_true_ca_rg=15.7622`.
- E05 interpretation: increasing selected face/tetra coordinate weights from
  `0.1` to `0.5` improved every scaled comparison point that matters for the
  collapse diagnosis: final lDDT, final FoldScore, final dRMSD, and realized
  radius of gyration. The run still remains far below the `0.7` target.
- E06 launched on pod `sytp4e4kjs7e61` at commit `1b5fae3` with the same
  scaled protocol and both selected coordinate weights set to `1.0`.
- E06 completed on pod `sytp4e4kjs7e61`: final and best
  `val_lddt_ca=0.3127`, final FoldScore `0.2511`, `val_ca_rmsd=15.5934`,
  `val_ca_drmsd=14.5496`, `val_pred_ca_rg=7.1388`, and
  `val_true_ca_rg=15.7622`.
- E06 interpretation: stronger selected face/tetra coordinate realization
  improved final lDDT and dRMSD over E05 and opened the structure further,
  but the radius-of-gyration gap remains large and the run is still far from
  the `0.7` target.
- E07 implemented selected simplex boundary-coordinate realization losses.
  The new losses supervise predicted C-alpha edge lengths only on boundary
  edges of the model-selected face/tetra cells, so the signal is mediated by
  the sparse simplicial complex instead of a dense all-pairs distance matrix.
  Defaults are off unless the runner passes
  `--simplex-face-coordinate-distance-weight` or
  `--simplex-tetra-coordinate-distance-weight`.
- E07 launched on pod `sytp4e4kjs7e61` at commit `b880e43` with the same
  scaled protocol as E06, selected face/tetra coordinate weights set to
  `1.0`, and selected boundary coordinate-distance weights set to `0.5`.
- E07 completed on pod `sytp4e4kjs7e61`: best `val_lddt_ca=0.3247` at step
  2000, final `val_lddt_ca=0.3187`, final FoldScore `0.2617`,
  final `val_ca_rmsd=16.0872`, final `val_ca_drmsd=12.9483`,
  `val_pred_ca_rg=9.1383`, and `val_true_ca_rg=15.7622`.
- E07 interpretation: selected boundary coordinate distances improve the best
  lDDT and materially improve realized local geometry over E06. This is the
  strongest topology-mediated direction so far, but still far from the `0.7`
  target.
- E08 launched on pod `sytp4e4kjs7e61` at commit `e77f141` with the same
  scaled protocol as E07 and selected boundary coordinate-distance weights
  raised from `0.5` to `1.0`.
- E08 was stopped early after the step-500 validation point regressed to
  `val_lddt_ca=0.2636`, FoldScore `0.2386`, `val_ca_drmsd=15.1396`, and
  `val_pred_ca_rg=6.0681`. Doubling selected-boundary distance pressure is
  worse than E07's `0.5` setting.
- E09 adds a `full_msa_to_face` benchmark variant so selected face states can
  receive low-rank third-order MSA moments while keeping tetra message passing
  active. This is a zero-parameter activation of the existing MSA-to-face
  path and directly tests the README's `MSA <-> sparse face tensor` claim.
